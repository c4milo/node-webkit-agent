This module is an implementation of
[Chrome developer tools protocol](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/protocol/1.0/index.html).
It is still pretty much a work in progress and only heap and CPU profilers are working right now. Help is wanted to finish implementing debugger, networking and console agents as well as a implementing from scratch a flamegraphs agent.

## Features
This module allows you to debug and profile remotely your nodejs applications
leveraging the following features by re-using the [built-in devtools front-end](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html)
that comes with any webkit-based browsers such as Chrome or Safari.

* Remote heap and CPU profiling
* More agents are coming.

## Installation
`npm install webkit-devtools-agent`

## Usage
From within your Node application, just require the module as usual, and start the agent. For example:

```javascript
var Agent = require('webkit-devtools-agent'),
    agent = new Agent();
agent.start()
```

Once the agent is initiated, use any of the following hosted Devtools UIs to profile your application.

**Node v0.6.x:** http://c4milo.github.io/node-webkit-agent/19.0.1084.46/inspector.html?host=localhost:9999&page=0

**Node v0.8.x and v0.10.x:** http://c4milo.github.io/node-webkit-agent/26.0.1410.65/inspector.html?host=localhost:9999&page=0

You can also change the agent port and binding address where it listen to by setting up the following parameters:

* **port:** The port for the Devtools UI to connect to using websockets. Set to `9999` by default
* **bind_to:** The host or IP address where the websockets service is going to be bound to. Set to `0.0.0.0` by default
* **ipc_port:** IPC port for internal use. Set to `3333` by default
* **verbose:** Whether to log more information or not. Set to `false` by default

See the example below to understand better how to set these parameters.

### Example
A more elaborated example looks like: 

```javascript

var agent = require('./index');

// Assume this HTTP service is your service
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    console.log('boooo');
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(9000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:9000/ , pid-> ' + process.pid);

// Now let's have a signal handler for SIGUSR2 that is going
// to activate the devtools agent. You can use any other means to activate
// the agent, not just signal handlers.
process.on('SIGUSR2', function () {
  if (agent.server) {
    agent.stop();
  } else {
    agent.start({
        port: 9999,
        bind_to: '0.0.0.0',
        ipc_port: 3333,
        verbose: true
    });
  }
});


```

## ABI compatibility
[ABI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) compatibility breaks between Node v0.6.x and v0.8.x. Therefore, if you switch Node versions you would have to re-install `webkit-devtools-agent` again. See issue [#11](https://github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent/issues/11).

Happy Debugging!
