This module is an implementation of
[Chrome developer tools protocol](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/protocol/1.0/index.html).
It is still pretty much a work in progress and only the heap and CPU profilers are working right now. Debugger, console
and networking will be added soon.

## Features
This module allows you to debug and profile remotely your nodejs applications
leveraging the following features by re-using the [built-in devtools front-end](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html)
that comes with any webkit-based browser such as Chrome and Safari.

* Remote heap and CPU profiling
* More agents are coming.

## Installation
`npm install webkit-devtools-agent`

## Example
```javascript
var agent = require('webkit-devtools-agent');
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8080, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('[%s] Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/', process.pid);
```
## Connecting to the agent

* Activate the agent in your nodejs application by sending a SIGUSR2 signal to its process id. The signal might vary depending on your platform. To de-activate, send the signal once again.
Example: 
```shell
$ kill -SIGUSR2 <the process id of your nodejs app> # any POSIX-complaint platform
$ kill -USR2 <the process id of your nodejs app> # OSX
```


* Using your browser, go to devtools frontend URL corresponding to your nodejs version:

##### Nodejs v0.6.x
http://c4milo.github.io/node-webkit-agent/19.0.1084.46/inspector.html?host=localhost:9999&page=0

##### Nodejs v0.8.x and v0.10.x
http://c4milo.github.io/node-webkit-agent/26.0.1410.65/inspector.html?host=localhost:9999&page=0

It's important to make sure your browser supports websockets, otherwise the front-end won't be able to connect to the node agent whatsoever.

You can also change the agent port and host where it listen to by setting up the DEBUG_PORT and DEBUG_HOST environment variables.

For more documentation about how to use and interpret devtools, please go to the [Devtools official documentation](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html)

## Heads Up
[ABI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) compatibility is breaking between nodejs v0.6.x and v0.8.x, therefore if you switch nodejs versions you would have to re-install webkit-devtools-agent again. See issue #11.

Happy Debugging!
